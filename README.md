## Welcome to Project 7

### Learning Objectives

- Gain more experience working with GitHub repos
- Gain experience working with GitHub Pages
- Create an initial CIT Minor portfolio for my labs and projects

### Overview

Rather than a final coding project, this project consists of creating an initial version of my CIT Minor portfolio using GitHub Pages. This project includes:

- Creating either an organization-level or user-level GitHub Page, and adding content to this Page. 
- Creating repos for each of the labs and projects for the CIT 281 class
- Creating a GitHub Page for each of the labs and projects that provides a brief description of the lab or project, and a screen capture
- Adding links to the organization or user Page to each of the labs and projects

### Code

Please click the **"View on Github"** buttom on the top of the page to see the portfolio link
